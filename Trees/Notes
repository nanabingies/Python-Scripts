- A Full Binary Tree is a special type of binary tree in which every parent node or internal node has either two or no children.

- A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two child nodes and all the leaf nodes are at the same level

- A complete binary tree is just like a full binary tree, but with some major differences:
1. Every level must be completely filled
2. All the leaf elements must lean towards the left.
3. The last element might not have a right sibling
ie. a complete binary tree doesn't have to be a full binary tree.
