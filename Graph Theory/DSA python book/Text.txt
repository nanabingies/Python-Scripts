# Some Theory on graphs from the book

Algorithm DFS(G, u):            { We assume u has already been marked as visited }
    Input: A graph G and a vertex u of G 
    Output: A collection of vertices reachable from u, with their discovery edges
    for each outgoing edge e=(u, v) of u do 
        if vertex v has not been visited then
            Mark vertex v as visited (via edge e)
            Recursively call DFS(G, v)
